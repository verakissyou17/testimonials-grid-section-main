            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny&apos;s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
            intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
            time of my life. Since completing the course, I&apos;ve successfully
            switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as
            an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
            a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
